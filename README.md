# InfinityHookProEx
This is an extension to InfinityHookPro to support physical machine environments.

This project is based on https://github.com/FiYHer/InfinityHookPro ,I changed the value of GetCpuClock to 1,This allows it to work in a physical machine environment.

But it is a pity that this location seems to be protected by patchguard :(
